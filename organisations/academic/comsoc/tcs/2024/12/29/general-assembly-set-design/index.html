          Historically, the Computer Society’s General Assembly sets the stage for groundbreaking discussions,
          innovation showcases, and memorable events. But this year, the stage itself was a masterpiece that stole the
          show. The 2024 GA set design exemplifies how technology and creativity converge to transform a visionary 3D
          model into an awe-inspiring reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 3-day General Assembly with the theme "The Capitol Games", based on the novel (then film) series Hunger
          Games, ran at the PUP Sto Tomas Campus' gymnasium from December 16 to 18, 2024.
        </p>

        <h4 class="h4">
          Conceptualizing the Design
        </h4>

        <p>
          The journey began weeks before the event with a brainstorming session between the Computer Society’s executive
          officers, design committee, technical committee, publication committee, aftercare committee, and production
          committee. Despite a limited budget and tight deadlines, the goal was to create a set that encapsulates the
          theme of this year’s assembly: “The Capitol Games.” Inspired by the dystopian elegance of the Hunger Games
          universe, the design team conceptualized a post-apocalyptic stage built primarily from repurposed materials,
          mainly broken chairs. This raw, industrial aesthetic reflected the theme’s essence of survival and resilience
          in a world reshaped by chaos.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial 3D model was designed in Blender. The committees wanted to evoke a sense of decay and
          transformation, turning everyday discarded items into a powerful visual statement. The design was a
          collaborative effort by ComSoc's members, showcasing their creativity and technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal was to transform the PUP Sto Tomas' gymnasium into an immersive post-apocalyptic visual experience
          for the audience. The plan was to ensure that the set design was chaotically beautiful from any angle and any
          seat in the audience.
        </p>

            Claro.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the challenges was achieving the balance between the chaotic look of the design and its structural
          stability. The team’s resourcefulness in balancing constraints ensured the project stayed on schedule and
          within budget.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 3D model was also used to present the expectations for the external productions that would also utilize
          the stage, like PUP Sto Tomas' cultural groups: Indak Batangan, the University's premier dance troupe, and
          Mozart's Guild, PUP STC's esteemed band.
        </p>

        <h4 class="h4">
          Lighting and Visual Effects
        </h4>

        <p>
          The lighting design played a pivotal role in bringing the stage to life. The team utilized what was available
          from the University's Facility and Management Office and used the lighting system wisely to maximize its
          effect. Using the Blender 3D model, the team planned out how the lighting rigs would be placed and
          incorporated into the expected feel of the set design.
        </p>

        <h4 class="h4">
          Assembly and Final Touches
        </h4>

        <p>
          Over the course of only a day, the design team created the main piece of the set design: The bird - the icon
          of the Hunger Games. The team used Styrofoam boards and gold metallic foil to bring the bird into reality.
          Soaring at dimensions of 7ft by 7ft, this piece of art served as the core of the set design, built to
          withstand the 3-day event. Despite the time constraints, the modular design allowed for efficient installation
          and adaptability to the space.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students played a critical role in this phase, bringing their ingenuity and hands-on effort to ensure the
          project’s success. Their contributions underscored the event’s spirit of fostering young talent and
          innovation.

        <h4 class="h4">
          The Rubble
        </h4>

        <p>
          To accentuate the post-apocalyptic theme, rubble was added. Due to the limitations of materials, the team
          utilized the most accessible option: broken chairs. The University had a stash of soon-to-be-disposed broken
          chairs. With the permission of relevant offices, the team was able to use the chairs as part of the immersive
          set design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amid the rubble of broken chairs, attendees could spot remnants of old props from the Computer Society’s
          previous events. These nostalgic elements paid homage to the organization’s history while seamlessly blending
          into the dystopian aesthetic. This creative reuse of materials not only aligned with the theme but also
          highlighted the Society’s resourcefulness and commitment to sustainability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artistic touches added to the set’s post-apocalyptic charm included spotlights, colored lights, and a smoke
          machine. Christmas lights and ring lights were woven into the rubble, providing intricate details that
          shimmered amidst the chaos. These elements amplified the immersive atmosphere and drew attention to key parts
          of the stage design.

        <p>
          By the time the General Assembly opened its doors, the stage was nothing short of a technological marvel.
          Attendees were greeted by a sweeping set that blurred the lines between art and tech, with every curve and
          contour narrating a story of boundless innovation amidst decay.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Computer Society's 2024 General Assembly <i>Capitol Games'</i> set design was more than just a backdrop;
          it was a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the magic of translating digital dreams
          into physical reality. Despite the challenges of a low budget and limited time, the team, composed of talented
          students, demonstrated that creativity and determination can overcome any obstacle. As the event concluded,
          one thing was certain: the stage had not only set the scene but also set a new standard for innovation and
          creativity in event design.
