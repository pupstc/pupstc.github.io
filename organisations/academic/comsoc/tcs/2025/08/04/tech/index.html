          The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) continues to strengthen its commitment to accessible and
          quality education by providing students and faculty with access to professional-grade digital tools through
          institutional partnerships with Microsoft and Adobe.

        <h4 class="h4">
          Microsoft Office 365 Access via PUP Email
        </h4>
        <p>
          All students and faculty members using the official @iskolarngbayan.pup.edu.ph email address are entitled to a
          full Microsoft Office 365 license. This includes access to widely used productivity applications such as
          Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and others. The license also provides 100GB of cloud
          storage via OneDrive, enabling secure and seamless file storage, sharing, and collaboration across multiple
          devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          These applications are available both online and offline through office.com, allowing users to work
          efficiently from any location.

          Adobe Creative Cloud Rollout for Selected PUP Community Members
        </h4>
        <p>
          In addition to Microsoft Office 365, PUP has recently partnered with Adobe to offer Creative Cloud All Apps
          access to selected students and faculty members. Eligible users have received personalized emails from Adobe
          containing detailed activation instructions. Access requires logging in with the @iskolarngbayan.pup.edu.ph
          email address.

          Supporting the Technical Empowerment of Iskolar ng Bayan
        </h4>
        <p>
          Access to these platforms plays a crucial role in the technical empowerment of PUP students, equipping them
          with essential digital competencies that are increasingly required in both academic and professional settings.
          By utilizing tools used in real-world industries, students enhance their practical skills and gain a
          competitive edge in the job market.

          These resources also support the university's broader mission of developing globally competent, technically
          equipped, and socially responsible graduates. Providing access to licensed software encourages creativity,
          innovation, and productivity—ensuring that the Iskolar ng Bayan is prepared to meet the demands of the digital
          age.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to former PUP Student Regent Kim Modelo, approximately 30,000 students from the Engineering,
          Information Technology, Business, Communication, and Tourism programs are currently included in the initial
          phase of the Adobe Creative Cloud rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modelo also shared that during the Board of Regents (BOR) meeting on October 8, 2024, a request was submitted
          to extend the benefit to all recognized student councils and organizations throughout the university system.
          The proposal was reportedly affirmed by several members of the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          She expressed optimism that with sufficient government support and increased funding, PUP may be able to
          expand Creative Cloud access to its entire student body—estimated at 95,000 students systemwide—by the next
          academic year.
