          The National Press Freedom Day serves as a reminder that journalism is more than just headlines and
          bylines—it is the lifeblood of democracy. Today, as the Philippines commemorates this day, the conversation
          extends beyond newsrooms and rallies into digital landscapes, where artificial intelligence and campus
          journalism are reshaping how stories are told.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology, particularly AI, has become both a challenge and an ally to the press. On one hand, it offers
          tools that speed up research, fact-checking, and dissemination of information. On the other, it raises
          questions about misinformation, ethics, and the human voice at the heart of storytelling. Amid these changes,
          what remains clear is that the spirit of a free press cannot be automated, it is built on courage, vigilance,
          and truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spirit is alive and thriving in the country's student publications and campus press organizations. Across
          universities, student journalists are embracing new platforms, experimenting with digital tools, and carving
          spaces for accountability and discourse. They are young but steadfast, proving that the pursuit of truth is
          not bound by age or experience. Their work reflects a timeless truth: freedom of the press begins where young
          voices are empowered to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the struggles confronting journalists remain stark and sobering. Killings of journalists continue to
          plague the country, making the Philippines one of the most dangerous places in the world to practice the
          profession. Censorship and intimidation persist in both overt and subtle forms, silencing voices that dare to
          criticize or question those in power. The menace of red-tagging, the baseless branding of journalists and
          campus writers as enemies of the state, has created a climate of fear that erodes trust and discourages free
          expression. Alongside these threats is the ongoing battle against fake news and disinformation, which spreads
          rapidly through social media, undermines public trust in legitimate reporting, and distorts the democratic
          process. These challenges, taken together, form the daily reality of many in the press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amid these struggles, international and local press freedom organizations, including Reporters Without Borders
          (RSF), are once again calling on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to release Frenchie Mae Cumpio, the only
          journalist currently detained in the country. Cumpio has been behind bars for five years without
          conviction—her case a chilling symbol of how the justice system can be wielded to stifle dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's observance is more than a ceremonial date on the calendar. It is a call to defend journalism in all
          its forms—mainstream and student-led, analog and digital, human and AI-assisted. It is a reminder that
          journalism is not terrorism but a public trust, a check against abuses, and a voice for those who cannot speak
          for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology evolves and younger generations step forward, the future of Philippine journalism is being
          written not just by seasoned professionals, but also by the hands of students wielding pens, keyboards, and
          algorithms. And in their stories, the promise of a truly free press lives on.
