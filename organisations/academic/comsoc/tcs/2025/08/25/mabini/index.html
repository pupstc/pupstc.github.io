          Every National Heroes Day, the nation honors the men and women who stood at the forefront of freedom,
          intellect, and service to the Filipino people. Among them is Apolinario Mabini of Tanauan, Batangas, the
          “Brains of the Revolution” and “Sublime Paralytic,” whose ideas shaped the birth of the First Philippine
          Republic. Bound by polio yet unbound in spirit, Mabini stands as living proof that disability is never a
          hindrance to greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born on July 23, 1864, Mabini grew up in modest circumstances, yet through hard work and brilliance, he rose
          to become one of the greatest legal minds of his time. His counsel to General Emilio Aguinaldo and his
          authorship of the Malolos Constitution laid the foundations for Philippine democracy. He never let his
          paralysis define his worth; instead, he wielded his pen and intellect as powerful weapons in the struggle for
          independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a time when many measured leadership through physical might, Mabini redefined heroism through integrity,
          intellect, and unyielding conviction. Even when imprisoned by American forces, he refused to compromise his
          ideals, showing that true strength lies not in body but in principle.
        </p>
        <div class="my-3">
          <div style="height: auto; width: 100%; overflow: hidden;" class="rounded-5">
            <img src="shrine.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Today, Mabini's legacy holds a profound place in the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP). The
          university's Main Campus in Sta. Mesa, Manila, proudly bears his name as the “Mabini Campus.” Within its
          grounds stands the Mabini Shrine, where his preserved home and memorabilia are displayed. This makes PUP not
          only a center of learning but also a living monument to Mabini's life and ideals. For generations of PUPians,
          Mabini is not just a historical figure but a daily reminder that education, resilience, and service to the
          people are pathways to nation-building.
        </p>
        <p>
          His story resonates even more in our modern era. With today's technological innovations—assistive devices,
          digital platforms, and inclusive design—people with disabilities have greater opportunities to learn, work,
          and lead. Mabini's life anticipated this truth long before technology caught up: limitations should never
          silence one's contribution to society. If he could guide a revolution from his wheelchair in the 19th century,
          then surely in today's world of accessible tech and open knowledge, no one should be left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this National Heroes Day, remembering Apolinario Mabini is more than recalling history—it is embracing a
          challenge. He calls on us to rise above personal and societal limitations, to use every tool at our
          disposal—whether knowledge, technology, or innovation—to shape a nation that is truly free and inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Philippines, Mabini is a national hero. For Batangueños, he is a hometown pride. For PUP, he is
          family, with the very heart of the university carrying his name. And for all of us, he remains a timeless
          reminder that no barrier—be it disability, poverty, or circumstance—can hold back a mind and heart determined
          to serve the nation.
