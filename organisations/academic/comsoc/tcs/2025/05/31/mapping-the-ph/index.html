          STO TOMAS - Christopher Jay De Claro, a faculty member of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Sto.
          Tomas
          Campus and a software engineer, has developed an innovative digital platform titled “Mapping the
          PH.” This project offers an interactive and data-driven visualization of the Philippines, with its latest
          feature dedicated to mapping the 2025 Elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessible at <a href="https://cjdeclaro.github.io/mapping-the-ph/"
            target="_blank">https://cjdeclaro.github.io/mapping-the-ph/</a> , the platform allows users to navigate the entire
          country—down to the barangay level—through a browser-based map interface. It utilizes modern technologies such
          as Leaflet.js for dynamic map rendering and IndexedDB for efficient offline caching of large geographic
          datasets. The result is a fast, lightweight, and accessible tool designed for educators, students,
          researchers, journalists, and citizens interested in localized data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally conceptualized as a technical challenge, “Mapping the PH” has since evolved into a civic tech
          initiative. Its core objective is to make geographic and political data more understandable and accessible,
          especially during key national events like elections. With the upcoming 2025 barangay elections, the platform
          provides a timely resource for tracking and understanding electoral developments at the grassroots level.
        </p>
        <p>
          De Claro, who has been teaching information technology courses since 2019, emphasizes the importance of
          applying technical skills beyond the classroom. Through this project, he demonstrates how software development
          and open data can contribute to civic engagement and public awareness. His dual role as an educator and
          developer allows him to bridge academic learning with real-world impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire project is open-source, with its source code available <a
            href="https://github.com/cjdeclaro/mapping-the-ph" target="_blank">in this github repository</a>,
          encouraging collaboration
          and contribution from developers, data
          scientists, and civic-minded individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project also maintains an <a href="https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61576244954918" target="_blank">official Facebook page</a>, where updates, announcements, and feature highlights are regularly posted. This page serves as a platform for engaging with the public, gathering feedback, and promoting digital literacy by showcasing how geographic and electoral data can be made accessible and meaningful through technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Philippines moves closer to the 2025 barangay elections, “Mapping the PH” stands out as a
          forward-thinking example of how technology can empower democratic participation—by placing crucial information
          into the hands of the people.
