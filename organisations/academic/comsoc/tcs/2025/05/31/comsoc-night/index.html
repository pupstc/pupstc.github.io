          STO TOMAS - The Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Sto. Tomas Campus’ (PUP-STC) Computer Society
          successfully concluded Academic Year 2024-2025 with their year-end celebration titled "404 ComSoc Not Found:
          The Grand ExIT & Year-End Celebration" on May 26, 2025. Students attended the event wearing Y2K-inspired
          outfits, following the theme of the celebration. The entire program brought together students and faculty
          members to celebrate the organization's successes throughout the academic year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program started with traditional opening ceremonies featuring the Philippine National Anthem and opening
          prayer conducted by the Audio-Visual Production team. Dr. Melani L. Castillo, Computer Society Adviser,
          delivered a welcome address and inspirational message, establishing the ceremonial tone for the celebration.
          The program highlighted the organization’s academic journey through "BSIT Journey – The Road to Graduation,"
          an audio-visual presentation by Ms. Julian Nicole Gorom, Computer Society Vice President for Internal Affairs,
          focusing on the students' academic progression and achievements.

        <p>
          The ceremony recognized fourth-year students with Certificates of Appreciation and Special Awards,
          acknowledging their dedication and contributions to the Computer Society. The event's academic focus was
          highlighted by the keynote presentation titled "AI: The New Power Tool of Every IT Professional," delivered by
          Mr. Christopher Jay De Claro, Co-Adviser of the Computer Society. His talk explored the growing role of
          artificial intelligence in IT environments, emphasizing the collaborative potential between human
          professionals and AI systems, as well as the emerging opportunities in the field. A live demonstration of a
          conversation with Google’s Gemini showcased the rapid evolution of AI technologies.

        <p>
          The event also highlighted the different talents of the Computer Society and the larger university community,
          with performances by ComSoc PUP Idol and guest group Mozart's Guild. A highlight of the celebration was "The
          ComSoc Journey A.Y. 2024-2025," an audio-visual show that recapped the organization's milestones, activities,
          and accomplishments from the previous academic year.
        </p>
        <p>
          A significant portion of the program was dedicated to recognition ceremonies, with committee members, ComSoc
          officers, and faculty members receiving Certificates of Appreciation for their exceptional contributions to
          the organization's success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Jomari G. Castillo, Vice President for External Affairs, delivered a heartfelt message of gratitude,
          acknowledging the unwavering support of the faculty and the active involvement of members. Closing the event,
          ComSoc President Ms. Janna Mae H. Macatangay reflected on the year’s accomplishments and shared the
          organization’s vision for the future.
