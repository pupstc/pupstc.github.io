          The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) has rolled out a new Learning Management System (LMS) this
          1st semester of Academic Year 2025-2026, but both students and faculty are already raising concerns over its
          usability, speed, and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system, accessible through lms.pup.edu.ph and powered by Moodle, was introduced across all PUP branches
          and campuses to streamline online learning and academic management. However, users report frequent slowdowns,
          downtime, and an interface that is difficult to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          One student shared frustration after being unable to submit assignments on time due to the sluggishness of the
          submission portal. Others noted that even loading a single page takes too long, disrupting classes and
          coursework.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform's heavy bandwidth requirement also poses a challenge for students relying solely on mobile data
          or unstable internet connections. “It's almost impossible to participate properly when you can't even open the
          site without waiting several minutes,” another student commented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faculty members have likewise struggled with delayed uploads and difficulty in accessing class records,
          further complicating online learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, the university has yet to issue a formal advisory addressing the issues or outlining
          steps for improvement. For now, students and faculty continue to grapple with a system that, instead of easing
          digital learning, has added another layer of difficulty to academic life.
