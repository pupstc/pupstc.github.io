          STO. TOMAS, BATANGAS — The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) Sto. Tomas has officially shifted to 
          online synchronous classes today, April 24, after the heat index in Ambulong, Tanauan—a nearby area—
          reached 43°C. The announcement was made by Campus Director Armando A. Torres in line with 
          Executive Order No. 12, series of 2025, which directs campuses to suspend in-person classes and move online when the 
          heat index reaches 42°C or higher.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          While the directive prioritizes the health and safety of students and faculty, the move has once again highlighted a major concern: 
          Sto. Tomas City currently lacks an official heat index advisory from its City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 
          Office (CDRRMO). Without a localized and reliable source of data, the campus was forced to rely on readings from Ambulong, which may 
          not fully reflect Sto. Tomas' actual conditions.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          It is still unknown whether the following days will also shift online, as the administration continues to monitor weather conditions. 
          Students are requested to stay tuned for further announcements.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          This situation arises at a particularly critical time - midterm exam week - when student concentration and physical comfort are 
          both essential. Across the Southern Tagalog region, the persistent heat has heightened health risks and disrupted learning routines.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Recently, The Searcher, the official student publication of PUP Sto. Tomas, conducted a student poll asking:
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">Tomasinong Iskolar, pabor ka ba sa patuloy na pagpapatupad ng face-to-face learning modality sa PUP Sto. Tomas?</p>
          </blockquote>
          The response was overwhelming: most students said "No," reflecting growing concerns over safety and comfort in the current weather conditions.
        </p>

          PUP Sto. Tomas is home to Iskolar ng Bayan, the majority of whom commute daily - often under intense heat. 
          This makes the availability of timely and accurate information not just helpful, but vital. In situations like this, 
          access to real-time, localized data can mean the difference between prevention and crisis. It empowers school administrators 
          to act swiftly and responsibly, and allows students to make informed decisions about their well-being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Responding to these broader concerns, the PUP Office of the Student Regent - the sole representative of over 95,000 Iskolars ng Bayan in the University's highest governing body, the Board of Regents - submitted a formal letter to all concerned offices. The letter requests that online classes be implemented to all PUP System campuses for the period of April 23 to 26, 2025. Additionally, the Student Regent called on the university administration to create stronger, proactive policies that address the recurring issue of extreme heat. As of writing, appropriate actions from the addressed offices are still pending.
        </p>

        </p>
  
        <p>
          The current gap in heat index advisories has amplified calls for the local government of Sto. Tomas to begin issuing reliable 
          environmental updates, especially during critical periods like summer. As climate conditions continue to shift, 
          information becomes a form of protection - one that the student population urgently needs and deserves.
