        <p>
          The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), one of the country's largest and most accessible state
          universities, is facing a staggering ₱8.4 billion budget cut for fiscal year 2025 — a blow that threatens to
          derail its efforts toward becoming a research-oriented and innovation-driven institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          PUP requested a budget of ₱11.8 billion, but only ₱3.42 billion was approved under the 2025 General
          Appropriations Act (GAA). This leaves a wide gap between the university's growing academic responsibilities
          and the actual funding it receives from the national government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its financial constraints, PUP continues to achieve academic excellence. The Sto. Tomas campus in
          Batangas has produced recent board topnotchers. Students from its Bachelor of Science in Information
          Technology (BSIT) program have even presented research abroad, representing the university at international
          conferences — accomplishments often made possible by personal funding or external sponsors rather than
          institutional support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across the PUP system, particularly in provincial campuses, faculty members are grappling with the harsh
          reality of conducting research with little to no financial assistance. Many research proposals have gone
          unsupported in recent years, with some faculty being forced to shoulder publication fees or cancel research
          plans entirely due to the lack of institutional funding. The university's campuses outside Manila are
          particularly affected, as they often receive limited allocations and lack dedicated research offices or
          equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The budget disparity between PUP's main campus and its satellite campuses further worsens the problem. While
          the Manila campus retains relatively better resources, branch campuses like PUP Sto. Tomas operate with
          minimal infrastructure, outdated facilities, and constrained administrative support — all while being expected
          to match the output of more established institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reduction in research funding has not only limited the scholarly work of faculty but also restricted
          opportunities for students to engage in meaningful research training. Without grants, stipends, or access to
          proper equipment, many promising research initiatives never move beyond the proposal stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situation highlights a troubling contradiction: the state demands that public universities become leaders
          in innovation and knowledge production, yet fails to provide the minimum funding necessary to sustain that
          ambition. PUP's case is emblematic of this mismatch between national vision and fiscal commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless the government takes serious steps to restore and increase financial support for research in state
          universities — and to ensure equitable distribution across campuses — the country risks undermining its own
          goals for academic excellence and scientific advancement.
