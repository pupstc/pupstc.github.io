          NATIONAL - For the second time in less than a decade, a proposed law seeking to convert the Polytechnic
          University of the Philippines (PUP) into a National Polytechnic University (NPU) has been vetoed—this time by President
          Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The move, citing “low performance indicators,” has drawn widespread criticism
          and fueled mass protests across PUP campuses nationwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NPU Bill aimed to grant the PUP System greater institutional autonomy—allowing it to enhance academic
          programs, streamline governance, and secure stronger government support. While many viewed the bill as a step
          forward for higher education, others raised red flags over clauses that hinted at creeping privatization.
          Provisions related to revenue generation and public-private partnerships sparked fears that institutional
          independence might come at the cost of accessibility, affordability, and public character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the bill reached Malacañang, students and advocacy groups had already mobilized against it, using
          hashtags like #PUPNotForSale, #NoToNPUBill, and #VetoNPUBill to warn the public of its possible implications.
          While they acknowledged the bill's intent to uplift the university, many insisted the solution must not
          compromise its role as a sanctuary of affordable education. For them, PUP should not be “autonomous but
          privatized.”

          A statement from the PUP Student Regent:
        </p>
        <p class="ps-2">
          <i>
            Marcos Jr. has vetoed the NPU Bill! This is an overwhelming victory of the collective action of the Iskolar
            ng
            Bayan. But this veto is not the finish line. It is a result of relentless organizing, mass actions, and the
            resounding call to reject the corporatization of our education.
            We welcome this development, but we must remain vigilant. The threat of privatization and commercialization
            persists as long as lawmakers continue to push for profit-oriented reforms.
            Time and again, the Sintang Paaralan must remain public, accessible, and pro-people university. Tuloy ang
            laban para sa pagbibigay ng 100% na pondo sa PUP!
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcos' veto reignited that debate—but with added outrage. His justification, citing low performance
          indicators, reportedly drew on 2016 data. In response, the PUP administration released updated figures and
          infographics highlighting the university's improved standing, including high licensure exam passing rates,
          program accreditations, and national recognitions. These developments, they argue, paint a far different
          picture from the one presented by the Palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The President's remarks were especially offensive to many in the PUP community, which has long taken pride in
          the university's progressive values and its mission to serve the Iskolar ng Bayan—students from marginalized
          and low-income sectors who often have no other access to quality higher education. PUP, home to over 90,000
          students across its campuses, is one of the largest and most affordable state universities in the country.

        </div>
        <p>
          In the wake of the veto, large-scale protests headed by the PUP Administration erupted on July 14 under the
          slogans #SavePUPCampuses, #PUPBudgetItaas, and #NoToPUPBudgetCut. Demonstrators rallied for increased state
          support, not only to secure the future of the PUP System, but also to demand justice for decades of budget
          neglect. Placards bearing
          messages like "Budget sa PUP, dagdagan, 'wag bawasan!"" echoed throughout campuses from Manila to provincial
          branches.

        <p>
          The concern now is not just the failure to pass the NPU Bill, but the very survival of the institution's
          mission. Many fear that without significant support and structural reform, more PUP campuses may suffer from
          budget cuts, resource shortages, and eventual closure.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this second presidential veto—following the first by then-President Duterte—calls are growing for a
          refiled and reworked version of the NPU Bill, one that delivers genuine autonomy while keeping PUP's public
          and pro-poor character intact. For the Iskolar ng Bayan, the fight is far from over.
