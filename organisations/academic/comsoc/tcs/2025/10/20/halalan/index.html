          After days of scrutiny and a temporary postponement of proclamations, the Polytechnic University of the
          Philippines Sto. Tomas Campus Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has officially confirmed the election of all
          twelve (12) Councilors in the 2025 Central Student Council (CSC) elections through Resolution No. 005, Series
          of 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          The announcement follows a series of developments that began when COMELEC discovered computational and
          procedural discrepancies in the vote tally, prompting the release of Resolution No. 004 on October 19, which
          postponed the proclamation of winners pending a full audit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a comprehensive verification process, the COMELEC clarified in Resolution No. 005 that the 50% vote
          threshold applies only to single-seat positions—specifically President and Vice President—and does not apply
          to multi-seat positions such as Councilors.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this clarification, COMELEC affirms and upholds the official results for all twelve (12) Councilor
          positions, confirming that each elected candidate received a valid and verified number of votes and is
          therefore duly elected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resolution further reiterated that the election process was conducted “in a fair, transparent, and
          consistent manner,” with all votes validated according to established criteria. It also encourages future
          amendments to the electoral code to better define thresholds and procedures for multi-seat positions to
          promote fairness and clarity in future elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier verified tallies show Edwil Grae S. Zapata leading the presidential race with 1,095 votes, while
          Cathleen Feith F. Sarco secured the vice presidency with 1,439 votes.
        </p>
        <p>
          COMELEC assured the student body that the release of Resolution No. 005 marks the conclusion of the review and
          validation process, reaffirming its commitment to accountability, transparency, and integrity in the conduct
          of student elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          This development officially confirms the full slate of elected CSC officers for 2025.
