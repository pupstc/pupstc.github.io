          October 2, 2025 — Students of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Sto. Tomas Campus (PUP-STC) staged
          a walkout and took to the streets in a historic and powerful protest condemning the bloody legacy of the
          Marcos dictatorship while also calling out the deep-seated corruption that continues to cripple the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mobilization, held on the 53rd anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law, was spearheaded by The
          Searcher, the campus' official student publication, alongside the Dibujo Art Society, Mozart's Guild, and
          Bagong Himig Batangan. The demonstrators called out both the brutal repression of the dictatorship and the
          ongoing decay of governance today. Student speakers particularly emphasized the rampant anomalies within
          government agencies, pointing to the scandal surrounding the DPWH flood control projects as a glaring symbol
          of how corruption thrives while ordinary Filipinos are left behind.
        </p>
        <div class="my-3">
          <div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;" class="rounded-5">
            <img src="walkout.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          At the heart of the protest stood a haunting art installation: a scarecrow, a broken television, chairs, and
          placards — representing the journalists, artists, and ordinary citizens silenced during the dictatorship. It
          served as both a memorial and a challenge: a call to refuse silence in the face of lies, repression, and
          systemic abuse.
        </p>
        <div class="my-3">
          <div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;" class="rounded-5">
            <img src="art.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The action began with a walkout from classes, as students marched across campus with chants thundering against
          tyranny and graft. At the New Building, speakers delivered fiery addresses drawing parallels between the
          killings, censorship, and injustices of Martial Law and the corruption and incompetence of today's government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cultural groups lent their voices to the protest. Mozart's Guild performed protest songs like Dekada '70 and
          Upuan, while Bagong Himig Batangan echoed the call with Tatsulok and Kapangyarihan. These performances
          amplified the reminder that the struggle for justice and accountability is far from over.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the performances, students marched toward the unfinished campus building under the DPWH's responsibility
          — a decaying structure that was meant to be a new learning facility. Now it stands abandoned with bent steel,
          moldy walls, and no sign of completion. To the students, the building symbolized how corruption and
          incompetence rob the youth of their future.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The program culminated with a solemn candle-lighting ceremony, dedicated both to the victims of Martial Law
          and as a vow to resist ongoing oppression and corruption. Professors, standing with their students, joined in
          the act of remembrance and defiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a searing statement, The Searcher declared:
          “Ang tunay na diwa ng pakikibaka ay matatagpuan sa walang humpay na pagsusulong ng katotohanan at katarungan.
          Mula noon hanggang sa kasalukuyan, ito ang aming paninindigan: Iskolar ng Bayan, Ngayon ay Lumalaban. Hindi
          dito nagtatapos, nagsisimula pa lamang.”
