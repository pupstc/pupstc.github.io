            As the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) Sto. Tomas Campus marks its 34th founding
            anniversary,
            the celebration is not only a remembrance of years passed, but also a tribute to moments when the campus
            stood
            firm in service of the people. One such defining moment unfolded on January 12, 2020, when Taal Volcano
            erupted, displacing thousands of Batangueños and altering lives in a matter of hours.

            In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, with Batangas province placed under a State of Calamity, PUP
            Sto.
            Tomas responded without hesitation. The campus swiftly opened its doors as an evacuation center, providing
            shelter to families forced to flee their homes. Its strategic location—accessible from Laguna and the
            National
            Capital Region—made it a vital hub not only for evacuees, but also for the steady flow of donations and
            relief
            goods coming from various sectors.

            Academic life momentarily paused as classes and the planned foundation week were suspended, giving way to a
            more urgent mission. Classrooms and the campus gymnasium were converted into sleeping quarters, while the
            canteen and the hallway of the Cultural Building became storage areas, soon filled with mountains of donated
            clothes and supplies from generous individuals and organizations.

          <p>
            At the heart of the campus response were its students, faculties, and staff. Almost immediately, they
            organized a volunteer network
            to assist the local government unit and manage the growing needs of the evacuees. Volunteers worked in
            shifting teams—receiving, sorting, and distributing donations; coordinating with external volunteer groups;
            and responding to urgent concerns within the evacuation center.

            Amid the efficiency and order was a quiet but powerful story of compassion. Donations poured in, mostly
            consisting of food, water, and clothing—basic necessities in times of disaster. Yet one simple item was
            overlooked: pillows. Many evacuees slept with their heads resting on bags, slippers, or the bare floor.
            Recognizing this, student volunteers devised a solution. Torn and unwearable clothes were collected,
            shredded,
            and stuffed into old t-shirts, which were then sewn into makeshift pillows. These handmade pillows were
            distributed to evacuees—small comforts that spoke volumes of care, empathy, and creativity.

            Even in crisis, the campus community understood the importance of morale. Student organizations took
            initiative in their own ways. The Searcher, the official student publication, diligently documented
            developments within the campus, keeping the public informed of the situation. Teatro Batangan, the campus
            drama guild, staged performances to bring laughter and relief to children affected by the disaster.
            Meanwhile,
            the Computer Society organized film showings, offering moments of escape and normalcy for evacuees enduring
            uncertainty. Other academic and non-acedemic organizations poured in their own efforts in easing the campus
            situation.

            The photos from this period—classrooms turned into sleeping spaces, hallways lined with donations,
            volunteers
            at work—capture more than a response to disaster. They capture a campus living out its ideals.

            In those challenging days of January 2020, PUP Sto. Tomas embodied the very essence of its guiding
            principles: “Mula sa'yo, para sa bayan” and “The Light of the Nation.” Beyond its role as an academic
            institution, the campus became a refuge, a service center, and a beacon of solidarity. As the campus
            celebrates 34 years of service, this chapter remains a powerful reminder that the true measure of an
            institution lies in how it stands with the people—especially in their darkest hours.
