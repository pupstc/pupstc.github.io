            When Nemesio Prudente took the helm of what was then the Philippine College of Commerce—now the Polytechnic
            University of the Philippines—he did not simply assume an administrative post. He stepped into a battlefield
            of ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1972, when Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law, universities across the country became sites of
            tension, surveillance, and resistance. Classrooms were no longer insulated from politics; they were
            entangled in it. And at PUP, Prudente stood firm in the belief that education could not—and should not—be
            divorced from the nation's struggle for democracy.
          </p>
          <p class="h3">
            A Campus Under Watch
          </p>
          <p>
            Martial Law sought to silence dissent. Student publications were monitored. Assemblies were curtailed.
            Activists were tagged, arrested, or forced underground. Like many institutions, PUP operated under the
            shadow of military oversight. Yet it also became known as a breeding ground for critical thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prudente's leadership shaped this identity. Rather than reducing the university to technical training alone,
            he championed a nationalist and socially responsive education. He emphasized that state universities bore a
            responsibility to the people—especially the marginalized sectors whose taxes sustained them. In a time when
            obedience was rewarded and questioning was dangerous, this philosophy was quietly radical.
          </p>
          <p>
            PUP students, many of whom came from working-class families, were acutely aware of the economic hardships
            that intensified during the dictatorship. Tuition hikes, labor issues, and human rights violations were not
            abstract debates; they were lived realities. The campus became a space where these concerns were discussed,
            organized, and, at times, protested.
          </p>
          <div class="my-3">
            <div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;" class="rounded-5">
              <img src="protest.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

          <p class="h3">
            Education as Resistance
          </p>
          <p>
            Prudente believed that universities must produce graduates who were not only skilled but socially conscious.
            Under his watch, PUP cultivated an environment where discourse on national issues was not suppressed but
            engaged. Faculty members and students alike participated in conversations about sovereignty, corruption, and
            civil liberties.
          </p>
          <p>
            This stance came at a cost. Prudente himself faced political persecution for his activism and nationalist
            views. His presidency was disrupted during the dictatorship, and he endured detention. Yet his commitment to
            academic freedom and democratic ideals never wavered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many ways, PUP's posture during Martial Law reflected its constituency. As a state university serving
            predominantly underprivileged students, it was deeply intertwined with the struggles of ordinary Filipinos.
            The institution did not merely observe history—it inhabited it.
          </p>
          <p class="h3">
            Legacy of Courage
          </p>
          <p>
            When the dictatorship ended in 1986 following the People Power Revolution, universities across the country
            reassessed their roles in the national narrative. At PUP, Prudente's leadership was remembered as a
            testament to principled governance in turbulent times.
          </p>
          <p>
            His legacy is not confined to administrative reforms or infrastructure projects. It lives in the culture of
            vigilance and engagement that continues to define the university. PUP's reputation as a hotbed of
            activism—sometimes criticized, often misunderstood—can be traced back to a period when speaking up required
            extraordinary courage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, discussions about academic freedom, state accountability, and civic responsibility still echo across
            its corridors. The questions remain familiar: What is the duty of a university in times of crisis? How
            should education respond when democracy is threatened?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nemesio Prudente answered these not with slogans, but with action. In the darkest chapter of Philippine
            political history, he insisted that a university must stand with its people—even when standing carried
            consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            And in doing so, he helped shape PUP not just as an institution of learning, but as a community of
            conscience.
